text = "My name is Mael Teddy Kamani, a Secondary 5 student at Lucille-Teasdale International School.

For this project, I created a detective game focused on non-verbal communication. In this story, players must observe characters closely, read their gestures, and uncover the hidden truth behind their actions.

Non-verbal communication is one of the most powerful tools we have. More than words, it reveals emotions, intentions, and secrets people try to hide. A simple glance, a change in posture, or a nervous movement can completely transform the meaning of a conversation.

Through this game, my goal is to help you understand how body language shapes interactions, influences relationships, and plays a key role in solving mysteries.

Pay attention—every detail matters.

Welcome to the investigation."
